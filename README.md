# Population-Aware Variant Classification
# 1. Overview
This project explores a large genetic variant dataset, integrating population-level information to predict the clinical significance of variants. The goal is to build a machine learning framework that can improve variant classification, aiding genetic research and personalized medicine.

# 2. Dataset Description
The dataset contains over 1 million genetic variants annotated with information such as allele frequency, clinical significance, and population distributions.

Key Fields:
Variant ID: Unique identifier for each variant.

Position: Genomic location of the variant.

Reference and Alternate Alleles: Base changes in the genome.

Allele Frequency, Allele Count, Sample Size: Measures of how common a variant is across populations.

Population Data: Aggregated allele frequencies for diverse ancestry groups.

Clinical Significance: Labels indicating pathogenicity (e.g., benign, pathogenic, uncertain significance).

Data Source & Collection
The dataset originates from large-scale sequencing studies and public genetic databases (e.g., ClinVar, gnomAD). It was curated to reflect genetic variation across different populations, making it valuable for understanding ancestry-specific risks in genetic diseases.

Use Case
Predicting variant clinical significance is crucial for genetic diagnosis and research. If successful, the model could help prioritize variants in clinical genetics, pharmacogenomics, and disease risk assessment.

# 3. Prediction Task
Objective:
We aim to predict the clinical significance of a variant using features like allele frequency, population distribution, and genomic context.

Practical Application:
Precision Medicine: Identifying likely pathogenic variants in patients.

Genetic Counseling: Assessing risk factors in hereditary diseases.

Drug Response Prediction: Recognizing variants linked to drug metabolism.

# 4. Process Overview
Project Narrative:
Initial Steps: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by filtering missing/invalid records and exploding multi-label clinical significance values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated population-level trends and correlations.

Feature Engineering: Created meaningful input features by encoding categorical variables.

Modeling: Trained multiple classification models to predict variant significance.

Validation & Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, recall, and AUC-ROC.

# 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
X and Y Variables:
X (Features): Position, allele frequency, allele count, sample size, population-level allele distributions.

Y (Target Variable): Clinical significance (Benign, Likely Benign, Likely Pathogenic, Pathogenic, Uncertain Significance).

Data Summary:
Total Observations (After Filtering): 374,432 rows

Feature-to-Observation Ratio: Approximately 1:17, ensuring sufficient data per feature.

Feature Distributions & Challenges:
Highly Imbalanced Labels: "Uncertain significance" dominates, requiring handling strategies.

Allele Frequency Skew: Most variants are rare (low frequency), affecting model learning.

Correlation Analysis:

Strong correlation between allele frequency and allele count.

Population-level frequencies reveal significant ancestry-based differences.

Visualization Highlights:
Correlation Heatmap for numeric features.

Distribution Plots of clinical significance labels.

# 6. Feature Engineering
Key Transformations:
Label Encoding for categorical variables (e.g., Clinical Significance).

One-Hot Encoding for population-specific attributes.

Feature Scaling applied to numeric fields (e.g., Min-Max normalization for allele frequency).

Rationale for Feature Selection:
Included population-level features to capture genetic ancestry differences.

Kept allele frequency-related fields due to their strong predictive power.

# 7. Model Fitting
Train/Test Split Strategy:
80% Training, 20% Test split while preserving class distribution.

Avoided data leakage by ensuring no population-specific bias in training data.

Models Considered:
Logistic Regression (Baseline).

Random Forest Classifier (Handles feature importance well).

Support Vector Machine (SVM) (For handling imbalanced classes).

Decision Trees & Ensemble Models (Bagging & Boosting).

Hyperparameter Tuning:
Grid Search & Cross-Validation to optimize model parameters.

Balanced Sampling to mitigate class imbalance issues.

# 8. Validation & Performance Metrics
Metrics Used:
Accuracy (Overall model correctness).

Precision & Recall (For imbalanced class handling).

AUC-ROC Curve (To assess classifier performance).

Results & Confusion Matrix Analysis:
Random Forest performed best, but still struggled with the "uncertain significance" category.

Misclassification Issues: Some benign variants were misclassified as uncertain.

# 9. Overfitting & Underfitting Analysis
Checked Learning Curves to ensure model generalization.

Applied Regularization in models like Logistic Regression.

Used Ensemble Methods to reduce variance.

# 10. Deployment Considerations
Potential Production Use:
Could be integrated into genomic analysis pipelines.

Used for population-specific variant filtering in clinical settings.

Precautions:
Predictions should be used alongside expert genetic interpretation.

The model may be biased towards available data, requiring updates as new variants are discovered.

# 11. Future Improvements
Next Steps:
More Data: Incorporate additional variant databases.

Advanced Features: Use genomic annotations (e.g., protein impact scores).

Refine Class Balancing: Better handle rare variant classes.

Deep Learning: Explore models like CNNs or transformers for genomic sequences.
